## Introduction

Huffman coding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. This project provides a user-friendly interface to compress and decompress text files using Huffman coding. The compression and decompression processes are performed through a Streamlit web app.

## Features

- **File Compression:** Upload a text file and compress it using Huffman coding.
- **File Decompression:** Upload a binary file generated by the compression process and decompress it to retrieve the original text file.
- **Streamlit Web App:** A user interface built with Streamlit for a seamless experience.
